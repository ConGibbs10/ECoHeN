Description: Implementation of the ECoHeN algorithm to extract communities from heterogeneous networks. Initialization and extraction are provided by `cluster_ECoHeN` and refinement is provided by `refine_ECoHeN`. One can extract a community from an arbitrary list of user supplied sets using `extract_ECoHeN`. An implementation of ZCMod is provided to partition a heterogeneous network into strictly heterogeneous modules; furthermore, an implementation of ESSC is provided as a special case of ECoHeN for homogeneous networks. Random heterogeneous networks can be generated with implementations of the generative form of the heterogeneous degree configuration (HDCM) model, `sample_heterogeneous_dcm`, and the heterogeneous stochastic block model (HSBM), `sample_heterogeneous_sbm`. A plotting function `viz_heterogeneous_sbm` allows one to visualize the block structure of networks generated by the HSBM. The quality of extracted communities can be assessed with `eval_jaccard` and `eval_community` for simulated and real networks, respectively.
